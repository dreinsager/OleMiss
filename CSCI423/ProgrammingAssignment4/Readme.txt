For Part A: 
This program is a way of calculating pie to use a technique known as 
Monte Carlovwhich involves randomization. 

1: To compile type 'gcc PartA.c  -lpthread -lm'



For Part B:
This extends Part A where you create several threads, each of which generates random points and determines if the points fall within the circle.

1.To compile type 'gcc PartB.c -lpthread -lm'

2. To run type './a.out <some number>'
    For example './a.out 10' will give the result of a random number for Pi

3. If no number is entered it wil say "Usage: ./a.out <number of threads>"

4. If multiple numbers entered For example : './a.out 10 20', this wil result in "Usage: ./b.out <number of threads>"

5. If a negative number it is going to say it will require a non-negative number
